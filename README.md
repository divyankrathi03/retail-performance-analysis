# retail-performance-analysis

📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes the sales performance of a multi-region retail store to identify revenue drivers, weak markets, and business risks.
The same dataset was analyzed using Excel and Python (pandas) to validate insights across tools and ensure consistency in decision-making.

🛠 Tools Used

Microsoft Excel – data cleaning, pivot tables, and an interactive dashboard

Python – pandas for data cleaning and analysis, matplotlib for visualization

📊 Key Analysis Performed

Cleaned missing and inconsistent values using realistic business rules

Calculated net price after discounts and total revenue

Analyzed revenue by region, product, and store

Compared results between Excel and Python to ensure accuracy

🔍 Key Findings

Revenue is heavily concentrated in a few regions, creating dependency risk

Phone products contribute the majority of total revenue

One region consistently underperforms due to lower sales volume

Accessories sell in higher volume but generate significantly lower revenue

Discounts do not always result in proportional revenue gains

💡 Business Recommendations

Reduce dependency on phone products by strengthening other categories

Investigate and improve distribution or marketing strategy in weak regions

Test controlled price or discount adjustments on high-volume, low-revenue products

Use region-specific strategies instead of uniform pricing or promotions
